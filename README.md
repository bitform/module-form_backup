## module-form_backup

The Form Backup module lets you back-up or make exact copies of your forms. It provides a simple interface to let you copy the form, form submissions, form Views and email templates. You can pick and choose what aspects you want copied, as shown in the screenshot to the right. This can be an extremely useful if you need to roll out multiple, identical forms and don't want to have to go through the Add Form process for each. Also, it can be a useful way to take "snapshots" of your form configurations and data so that it's available later for reference or archiving purposes.
